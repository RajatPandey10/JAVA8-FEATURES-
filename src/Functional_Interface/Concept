ðŸ”‘ What is a Functional Interface?

A functional interface is an interface that has exactly one abstract method
(SAM: Single Abstract Method).It can have any number of default or static
methods, but only one abstract method.They are used for Lambda Expressions
and Method References in Java 8+.

âœ… Examples of Functional Interfaces

Predefined ones in java.util.function package:

Runnable â†’ run()
Callable<T> â†’ call()
Comparator<T> â†’ compare()
Predicate<T> â†’ test(T t)
Function<T,R> â†’ apply(T t)
Consumer<T> â†’ accept(T t)

A functional interface is the backbone of Lambdas in Java 8.
Itâ€™s an interface with one abstract method, and it makes code more readable, concise, and expressive
